\xpartbox{Conclusion}

\begin{xpsectionbox}{}{}
Having a goal to enable image based query capability in the People Locator\texttrademark (PL) system, we studied several image matching and face recognition methods, evaluated a few state-of-the-art systems on existing data-sets and developed core tools for image near-duplicate detection, face detection and face matching.

The near-duplicate image detector tool [Jacobs et al,1995] helps the DB administrator to clean up or group near-duplicate images in the PL data-base. The face detection capability relies on Viola-Jones object detection method, improved by the skin detection techniques. The face matching subsystem uses Haar, SIFT, SURF and ORB descriptors in an ensemble to take capitalize on the strengths of its constituents, and result in a higher accuracy figures than any of the individual descriptors.
